Open Hardware Monitor

A monitoring system for your system's temperatures, loads, power and more, built in C#. 

Keeps track of what the longest running maximum value for any given parameter is, so that after a long gaming or video-editing session, you can check to see how your CPU and GPU's temperatures have performed.
